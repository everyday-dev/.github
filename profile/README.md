# everyday dev | electronic product design
At everyday dev, engineering isn't just a job - it's our passion. We thrive on the joy of creating innovative solutions day in and day out. Aside from creating products for others we also share our open-source work so others can learn and build it themselves. Check out our projects below and let us know if we can help you out in any way.
